13. Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

    Browsers are a program that functions by a user using its interface to ask for content directed by the browser engine through the network to a server, the content is located then retrieved from the web. The browsers rendering engine and javascript interpreter then deciphers the web language (html and css) to show the content on a page; data storage allows the users page to stay the same even if it is refreshed. There are many types of browsers, depending on the device or itâ€™s usage, I surf on Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
