      <h1>Why Yeast Buns?</h1>
      <pre>
        Yeast buns, delicious bread, can come in a variety of shapes, consistencies, and sizes
        all can complement a dish. I chose this project because this dough is versatile, I use
        the same variation of recipe to make fry bread like my grandma taught me.
        Being able to make a dough that can double as yeast buns and frybread is important to me
        because not only am I using something taught to me by my grandma, but it makes me happy
        knowing I can make them. Iâ€™m happy being able to make food that makes my family happy
        when we all eat together. See <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/types-of-bread/"target="_blank"> Taste of Homes </a> article about all the wonderful types
        of bread and rolls in the world for more information.
