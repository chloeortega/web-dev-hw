1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

    While learning HTML in class, some of the topics discussed I had heard before, but I was never comfortable with using. Now I feel better about using semantic mark up, adding tables, and making lists. A thing that was interesting for me to learn about was the Iframe element and using them to add images, video, and audio. A thing for me that was difficult for me to learn was the four main elements and polite code, I think I just need more practice and repetition. I can understand when I’m reading about it, but when implementing them I overthink and get overwhelmed.  

2. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

    I’m excited for the next module on CSS to expand on styling to decorate HTML. I’m anxious about the amount of code that is being built up and not being able to find a correction that needs to be made if my work doesn’t display. I’m also anxious about not being able to build up code properly or adding in new elements to make short cuts but me getting confused on how to use it. I’m just nervous about getting confused and not being able to style anything at all or it looking funny.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

    This week I started by going through the material in the HTML Website module on the Intro-Web-Dev website and went back on the suggested topics for review. I then looked as the assignment for the week and browsed through the Instructables website to get an idea I want to do. A particular thing that I learned that I would like to discuss further is working with classes and building up the code in style. I had a few minor problems when I was working on my homework, my table style wasn’t displaying. In order to solve these problems, I rearranged its placement in the style element and added a new color I discovered my problem to be I accidently omitted the solid before my color. I also noticed some elements showed up in Mircosoft Edge while others didn't in Chrome and vice versa. I know I need to work on my structure and using polite code.
