3.	Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This week I started off going over the material from the Intro-Web-Dev website and HTML & CSS book. After going over the assignment parameters I researched website designs and layouts. I decided to design a simple website layout that would help me get comfortable manipulating the code for my desired outcome for more advanced layouts. I had a few minute problems, my content was not displaying how I wanted it too. To solve this problem, I made another container for that information and was able to place it where I wanted. A problem that I have yet to solve is, my interactive links move my right boxes content and Iâ€™m unsure where the link is that is doing that. Next time I plan to reach out to the instructor or try to use the issues form to get some insight.
