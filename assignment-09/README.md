1.	Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

      The different types of selectors include the universal, element, class and id, they each designate a rule to either a specific element or every element on the page. The universal selector designates rules to every element on a page. The element selector designates rules to certain types of elements. The class selector designates rules to class attributes that have been specified. The ID selector designates rules to specified id attributes after the #. You might choose the universal selector to specify a rule you want all through the page rather than using more than one selector to for example, align content and text to the right.

2.	Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

      My color palette was inspired by the 1970’s, the 4 colors I chose were brown (maroon), red, orange, and yellow. The hex codes for my color palette are #590c10, #a1120d, #de9910, and #faf5a0. The text on my page is white, the hex code for that is #FFFFFF.

3.	Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

      I really enjoyed the assignment and material for this week, I feel a little better experimenting with structuring my code to apply rules to elements across my web page rather than doing it individually like I feel most comfortable with. This week I started by reading over the Intro-Web-Dev, the HTML & CSS readings, then looking over the assignment. After I picked my decade I wanted to explore, I gathered my materials along with their citations. I would like to have more of an understanding if there is a “rule of thumb” of how I should break up my code, or is it just something that gets easier with time and practice? I had a few minute problems, my width was not working, my divs were ontop of each other instead of beside each other, and some of my pictures weren’t transparent. I looked through my code and my width wasn’t working because I forgot a semicolon before declaring it. I was able to use w3docs.com to understand float to have my divs beside each other rather than ontop of each other. I was able to find png images rather than jpg images to ensure a transparent background.
