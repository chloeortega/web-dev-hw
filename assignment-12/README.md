# Assignment 12

1.	Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client name is Elora and she is a wedding photographer. She needed a site that was bright, welcoming, and romantic. It needed to utilize links to her instagram, twitter, and facebook to find more information about her and other types of photography she does. The home page needed to capture the viewer and give information about her site. It was important the introduction section gave some background information about herself and her vision while capturing a client’s special day, it was important to her to have a clear photo of her beside the information. The portfolio page needed to showcase some of her work and give information about package details accompanying the examples. The contact page is meant for her to know her clients a little more and build a community to help her business.


2.	What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Display-block displays content in a block takes up the all available width and starts a new line. Display-inline makes elements display on the same line as the block it is nested in, it doesn’t follow the margin’s rule, it occupies the space it needs horizontally, and its bottom and top cannot be manipulated. Display:inline-block makes elements follow the rules of vertical spacing and margins, it will resize to copy the parent container so setting the width and height is a must.


3.	Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

This week I started off by reviewing modules 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12, then re-reading chapters in the CSS & HTML book. I’m not sure if I was able to utlize the display properties as well as I could. I need to review the subject and practice more. After reading the assignment I brainstormed and researched types of businesses and their websites. After deciding upon a business, I imagined the client and what their needs would be. After sketching some simple website layout designs I started working on it. Then I decided on a color palette. A problem I had was trying to make multiple boxes align a certain way, in order to solve this I went and individually worked on them and set the placement with position:absolute.
