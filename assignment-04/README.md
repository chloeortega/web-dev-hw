1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

  I used The Wayback Machine to visit a website I would visit when I was a young warthog, PBSkids.org from 2001, looking at it brought back a wave of nostalgia. In 2001, the website had a simplistic layout, it contained a two tone background with a few graphics/logos to click on, a plain white text alphabetical list of cartoons to click and view content from the specified selection. There was a text link to a TV schedule to inform the viewer airtime of each cartoon and a few pictures what was featured. Looking at the website now in 2020 it has changed significantly. The page increased the colors and interactivity, there is movement when a user scrolls over certain graphics/logos as well as added sounds, for example an enthusiastic little kids voice will say, “Games.” Some graphics change color when you scroll over them and the number of cartoons has increased as well as additional new cartoons have been added.

2. Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

  The Git module was set at a good pace, there were many new concepts that I learned some were easier to understand, some were difficult and others I need to practice to fully comprehend. I learned the difference between the internet and web, how to organize my files, how to develop in a text editor, and which browsers I should use in class. An easier concept I learned was how to name my files and folders because I had a similar naming practice in place, here I was able to make it more efficient. A difficult concept for me to grasp was the 4 main document elements and committing to memory the basic layout of and HTML document. I need to practice more with GitHub and switching between HTML and Markdown.
