          <h1> Introduction to Chloe Ortega </h1>
            <p>Pevehe e’šeevehe! Éšéévá'e na hehe seve vehe, Ho’o’seo’he’e na hehe stahe. Na So’taa’e naa na Mé'šeeséve'ho'e. Naohke naneoahta naa oha nasaa pehe So’taavenestse. </p>
            <p>Good day! My name is Chloe Ortega, my Cheyenne name is “Day Woman”, I live in Colstrip, Montana. I am Northern Cheyenne and Mexican American, I am an aspiring digital artist, painter, and writer, my art is influenced by my mixed heritage. My influences give me infinite possibilities in my creative process.</p>
            <p>I attended Chief Dull Knife College where I graduated with my associate of science, while there it inspired me to switch majors having been surrounded by the culture. I transferred to the University of Montana pursuing a degree in Media Arts. One of my prime motivations is to help create content to help Northern Cheyenne language preservation. There are only about 240 fluent speakers of the language alive, it’s important for me to help preserve my culture for future generations.<p>
            <p>Attending Chief Dull Knife College, I have taken part in the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and received the First Generation Scholarship Award twice. From there I worked with the American Indian College Fund as one of their college ambassadors. I have been able to travel to places such as Chicago, Illinois, and help build a bridge from Chief Dull Knife College to other Universities such as Northwestern for students.</p>
            <p>When I’m not working on projects for school I’m working on personal projects, spending time with family, or cooking. I have been working on completing a book of Cheyenne taboos that have illustrations, the Cheyenne/English translations and voice recording of what it sounds like. In the summer, I work in an internship alongside linguists helping build a Cheyenne language database. I hope one day my art will help inspire and preserve my culture.</p>
