1. Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

Almost every aspect of web development was something new to me. I learned that you can change your code in GitHub rather than using atom to change code and pushing the changes. I learned that it takes many steps to make the internet run smoothly and how the infrastructure allows for computers to talk to each other. I also learned that it takes a lot of work to build and maintain a website, not including the designing aspect of it.

2. Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

  I learned many new things about web design, before I had only been exposed to some HTML elements but now I have many to familiarize myself with better. I learned that there are many aspects to the elements that we learned, for example typography. I learned about how media is shared and how it can appear differently depending on the browser you are using. I also learned about the importance of color and how color palettes can help set the mood of a website.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

For my final project I revisited my previous CSS website I designed and utilized the parts I wanted. I mulled over my design in my head for a few days and then sketched a rough draft. I then gathered my media I wanted to use in my pages, I made sure to try my best and use polite code and add comments to keep myself organized. I chose my color palette, but I didn’t like how it turned out so I took inspiration from my pair of elk bone earrings and used them to make a new palette. I really enjoyed the class and learning about all the steps that it takes into creating a website, there is still so much I need to practice with. I still have trouble working inside boxes inside of boxes. Using “absolute” I was able to position my content the way I wanted, but I know there should be a simpler way to accomplish what I needed. Something I would like to discuss further is how to change code that you have previously declared to have a different look in another part of the page. For example if you declared h1 for a heading on one page, then how do you change h1 to look different in another page, do I have to work inside another container?
