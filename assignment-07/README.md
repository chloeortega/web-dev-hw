1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Divs let us combine elements together in a block-level box, they can be nested together or singular. Classes attribute is used to identify and give HTML elements selected value, using the same values it groups alike elements that makes styling element simple because they share a CSS code. Ids also known as “global identifiers”, identify an element uniquely and this allows for single styling. Spans are like the div element, but they are used inside divs as an identifier to put together data that needs more styling or extra organization.

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

The “alt text”, alt attribute, is given when using an image that gives alternative information about it. We use the “alt text” to provide a user with alternative information in case there is something wrong with displaying the image.

3. Free Response

This week I started by going through the material in the Media module on the Intro-Web-Dev website. I then started on answering my weekly questions on my assignment. I then downloaded all the provided material for the week’s assignment and started to construct the index.html page. A particular thing that I learned that I would like to discuss further is finding materials that are free for usage. I had a few minor problems when I was working on my homework, my music video wasn’t playing when I was using working locally and I couldn’t find an album cover that was labeled for resuse. In order to solve these problems, I emailed the instructor and she suggested I push my work and display on GitHub, it worked. I used an album cover that was not safe for usage and gave credit to the author in my code.
