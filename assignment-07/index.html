      <h1>Lyrics<h1>
        <pre>

          I came in from the outside
          Burnt out from the joy ride
          She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
          Played from the bedside
          Is "Stella By Starlight"
          "That Was My Heart"
          The drums that start off "Night And Day"

          The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
          I'm almost me again, she's almost you

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
          The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
          Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft
          As Chet can sing "Let's Get Lost"
          And "Let The Good Times Roll"
          Let "Smoke Rings" from this "Paper, Doll"
          Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of
          "It Don't Mean A Thing"

          I've got some colour back, she thinks so, too
          I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't
          I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
          I wouldn't know

          "The Very Thought Of You" and "Am I Blue"?
          "A Love Supreme" seems far removed
          "I Get Along Without You Very Well, " some other nights
          The radio news reader chimes
          Reporting "Russian Lullabies"
          She'll turn to me awake and ask, Is everything "Alright"

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me
          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me

          I wouldn't know where to start
          "Sweet Music" playing "In The Dark"
          Be still "My Foolish Heart, "
          Don't ruin this on me
