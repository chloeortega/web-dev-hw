1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

  A page will have one head and one body element. The head element holds data about the page and will contain the title element and 4 meta elements. The character set lets the browser know what language you are using, view port contains the size and scale of the browser window, description describes the page, and author that contains the who wrote it. The body element contains all the information that will be shown to the user on the browser window it uses the HTML tags.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

  Structural markup are elements used to give a document structure using paragraphs, lists, breaks, and headings. Semantic markup provides additional details in a document such as emphasis on a phrase or word, where changes have been made, and where a quote has been used.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

  This week I went through the course material and utilized the HTML & CSS book for the TODO sections. It was helpful to have the review of the main elements and the additional time using websites to practice typing code. I enjoyed the section of Proper and Polite Code, it would be helpful to get some more tips on how not to get overwhelmed when the amount of code starts to get bigger. A slight issue I encountered was on the assignments instructions, 7 and 8 were similar steps I wasnâ€™t sure if this was a duplicate, I solved the issue by reading the instructions side by side.
