1.	What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

      A system font is a font that exists on the computer and is used frequently. A web font is obtained by downloading files from a resource. A web-safe font is a font that will likely to be able to display across many devices. Depending on what you're trying to accomplish each have their own unique properties and will help with your goal.

2.	What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?

      It is important to have a fallback font or a font stack because your initial font choice may not load by the browser so youâ€™ll have those to load that slightly resemble the original you picked instead of the browser loading a default font.

3.	Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

      This week I began my work cycle by covering all the material in the Typography module on the Intro-Web-Dev website and HTML & CSS book. After reading the assignment for the week I picked a story I loved as a child and used a citation to source an illustration, my color palette was inspired from the colored cover of the book. I got slightly frustrated breaking things down into larger sections and deciding where I needed to style things. I ended up breaking down my code into smaller blocks, but I would like to try and design another page like this because I know being comfortable having blocks will benefit me in the future. Another thing I need to get used to is commenting on all the elements and reminding myself what they are doing in the code, as well as taking small breaks in my work. I have the tendency to finish an assignment in one sitting rather than take my time and work through it with small breaks.
