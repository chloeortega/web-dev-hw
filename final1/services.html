            <h1><em>Havana Love Story</em></h1>
              <p>This project was inspired by the timeless appeal of Havana, Cuba. I wanted to make a story on canvas, the photos provide a story of a married couple dancing throughout the years. I wanted it to appear the photos were laying atop of love letters that have been written over the years. The color palette is blush to symbolize romance.
              </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-information" id="portfolio2-info">
          <h1><em>Stone Chief: Prayer<em></h1>
            <p>This project was inspired by the Northern Cheyenne culture, prayer is very sacred and is practiced in every aspect in life. The photo of a native chief is carved from stone and sits next to my eldest brothers’ burial spot. The rough translation from Cheyenne to English is “Great Spirit, we thank you for giving us life. Help us, lead us. Take us to where it is good. Take us around where it is not good. That’s it. We thank you.” I used a deep color palette to allow the text overlay to standout against the background.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-information" id="portfolio3-info">
          <h1><em>Gray Skies</em></h1>
            <p>This project is a water color painting made on mixed canvas. I wanted to challenge myself to work with a darker color palette because I tend to gravitate towards light colors. Making the moons reflection in the water and making the moon show illumination were my favorite aspect on the piece.
            </p>

        <div class="portfolio-information" id="portfolio4-info">
          <h1><em>Abstraction Universe</em></h1>
            <p>This project was made in Photoshop combining pictures of my diffuser. I really enjoy art inspired by galaxies and constellations I wanted to make my own interpretation of it. The color palette is colorful and create a tunnel affect. Moving this piece into animation would give it another life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="portfolio-information" id="portfolio5-info">
          <h1><em>Universo</em></h1>
            <p>This project was made in Photoshop combining text overlay and mixed images. I was inspired by my favorite Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. The rough English translation is, “I love the handful of the earth you are. Because of its meadows, vast as a planet, I have no other star. You are my replica of the multiplying universe.” I have always loved poetry, I think its fascinating poetry written in other languages, if there are any meanings lost in translation to English. Bringing the expert to a visual can help show the intended message to more of the audience.

        <div class="portfolio-information" id="portfolio6-info">
          <h1><em>Dance</em></h1>
            <p>This was my first project made in Photoshop using rotoscoping that I used in my final project for my Creative Coding class. I wanted to have a couple’s silhouettes dancing with the main focal point being the woman’s dress. I decided to do silhouettes with no facial features so it could capture what the act of dancing is and not who the people are; two people sharing a special moment. My full project utilizing this dance can be seen on my <a href="https://chloeortega.github.io/120-work/Final-Project/" target="_blank">github website.</a> I was inspired by one of my favorite singers, Ella Fitzergald, to create a project around a song.
